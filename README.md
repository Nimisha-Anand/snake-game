Interactive UI: Includes buttons for "Play," "Pause," "Retry," and "Exit" for a user-friendly experience.<br>
Game Over Screen: Displays a clear and visually engaging "Game Over" message with retry options.<br>

<h5>How to Play:</h5>
Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to navigate the snake.<br>
Collect food to grow your snake and increase your score.<br>
Avoid collisions with the walls and your own body to keep the game running.<br>
Collect power-ups for additional challenges or bonuses.<br>

<h5>Tech Stack:</h5>
Language: Python<br>
Framework: Tkinter for GUI development<br>
